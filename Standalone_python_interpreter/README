The `build_standalone_python_interpreter` can be used to build
a standalone version of the Python interpreter that "just works"
on (almost) any linux machine, without the need to install any
dependencies on that machine. This can be useful to get Python
quickly up and running on e.g. a supercomputer.

We use a container to build the Python interpreter on an old
version of a Linux distro with an old version of the GNU C
standard library (glibc). We have to use an old version of
glibc to guarantee backwards compatibility on older hardware,
such as supercomputers. The easiest way to get access to old
glibc versions is by running an old linux version in a container.

* A tool called `pyoxidizer` is used to build the interpreter.
* The virtual environment is managed with `singularity`, which
  is similar to docker. 
* The .def file is `singularity`'s equivalent to the `Dockerfile`.
