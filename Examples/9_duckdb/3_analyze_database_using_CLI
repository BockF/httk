DuckDB is an SQLite-type database specifically designed for data science
type of usage cases. See https://duckdb.org/ for more information.

1) Open the database in DuckDB CLI by typing `./duckdb sample.duckdb`

2) Much of SQL and SQLite is supported, so we can try commands like:

  * `.tables`
  * `pragma table_info('structure');`
  * select total_energy, k_vrh, g_vrh from result_elasticresult;
